### Confusion Matrix
```
                Predicted
Actual    Deadlock  No Deadlock
Deadlock      2          2      (True Positives: 2, False Negatives: 2)
No Deadlock   0          2      (False Positives: 0, True Negatives: 2)
```

### Detailed Test Results

1. **No Deadlock - Simple Communication**: ✅ True Negative

   - Detection time: 0.0020s

2. **Circular Wait Deadlock**: ✅ True Positive
   - Successfully detected classic circular wait deadlock
   - Detection time: 0.0035s

3. **Resource Contention Deadlock**: ✅ True Positive
   - Correctly identified resource contention deadlock
   - Detection time: 0.0000s

4. **Complex Communication Pattern**: ❌ False Negative
   - Failed to detect complex communication deadlock
   - Detection time: 0.0000s

5. **Large Scale System (100 philosophers)**: ❌ False Negative
   - Missed deadlock in large-scale system
   - Detection time: 0.0010s

6. **False Positive Test**: ✅ True Negative
   - Correctly avoided false positive in complex non-deadlock scenario
   - Detection time: 0.0000s

## Performance Analysis

### Strengths
1. **High Precision**: 100% precision means no false positives - the method is very reliable when it detects a deadlock
2. **High Specificity**: 100% specificity means it correctly identifies all non-deadlock cases
3. **Fast Detection**: Average detection time of 0.0011s enables real-time monitoring
4. **Consistent Performance**: No false positives across all test cases

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Recall**: 50% recall means the method misses half of the actual deadlocks
2. **Complex Pattern Detection**: Struggles with complex communication patterns
3. **Large Scale Systems**: Performance degrades with system size (100 philosophers)
