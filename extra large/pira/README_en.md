## üîç Introduction

The Dining Philosophers Problem is one of the classic problems in computer science used to understand concurrency and deadlock concepts. In this problem, several philosophers sit around a table, and each needs two forks (one on the left and one on the right) to eat.

### The Problem:
- Each philosopher is either thinking, hungry, or eating
- To eat, each philosopher needs two forks
- Forks are shared (each fork is shared between two philosophers)
- If all philosophers pick up their left fork simultaneously, a deadlock occurs

## üî¨ TPMC Approach

TPMC (Two-Phase Model Checking) is an approach developed by Mr. Pira and colleagues that includes two main phases:

### Phase 1: Graph Transformation Systems (GTS)
- System modeling as graphs
- Definition of transformation rules for state changes
- Creation of system state space

### Phase 2: Bayesian Optimization
- Use of Bayesian optimization algorithms
- Intelligent search in state space
- High-accuracy deadlock detection

### Key TPMC Features:
- **100 iterations** for the algorithm
- **Exploration bounds** proportional to problem size
- **Advanced deadlock detection** with cycle and waiting chain analysis
- **Bayesian optimization** for selecting the best action

## üìà Results Analysis

### Performance Metrics:
1. **Stability Score**: Higher values indicate more stable system
2. **Resource Contention**: Lower values indicate less resource competition
3. **Graph Density**: Indicates complexity of relationships in the system
4. **Number of Deadlocks**: Indicates algorithm efficiency

### Types of Detected Deadlocks:
1. **Circular Wait**: Circular waiting patterns
2. **Waiting Chain**: Linear waiting chains
3. **Resource Contention**: Intense resource competition
4. **Mixed**: Combination of the above types
